# Mac Duo

**Wish you could bring the iPhone Duo effect to your MacBook?**

Close the lid and watch your screen content tilt, blur, and fade as it moves.  
Mac Duo adds this effect to your MacBook, with controls in the menu bar.

**Available in:** English and Simplified Chinese (简体中文).

With the default settings, it's recommended to view the effect in front of your MacBook.

- **Window server rendering:** By default the macOS window server blurs and dims the live screen itself, modelled on a frosted sheet lifted off a page: the screen stays where the glass started, each point blurs by how far the glass has moved away from it, sharp at the hinge, and darkens by the light it loses. Nothing is captured, so no Screen Recording permission is needed.
- **Low power:** The lid sensor pushes its readings, so the app sleeps until the lid moves.
- **Metal rendering:** Turn on "Screen capture" to capture the screen with ScreenCaptureKit and render it with Metal instead, with the picture leaning back. The blur is a stack of true Gaussian blurs half an octave apart: exact at the hinge, smooth at full strength, and dithered against banding.
- **Adjustable perspective:** With screen capture, tweak the lean and perspective to suit your viewing position.
- **Haptics:** The trackpad taps as the lid closes, in a pattern of your choice: even detents, tiny taps that come faster and faster, taps that swell, or one at the start and one at full effect.
- **Out of the way:** Hide the menu bar icon if you like; open Mac Duo again to bring up its settings.

## Download

[Download DMG](https://github.com/sumimakito/Mac-Duo/releases/download/dev/Mac-Duo-dev.dmg) | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/sumimakito/Mac-Duo/releases/download/dev/Mac-Duo-dev.zip)

These downloads contain the latest [development build](https://github.com/sumimakito/Mac-Duo/releases/tag/dev) for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

Requires macOS 14 or later and a MacBook with a compatible lid angle sensor.
Screen Recording permission is only needed if you turn on "Screen capture".

## Build

Requires Xcode with Swift 6.0 or later. Run from the project directory:

```sh
./build.sh
```

The script creates `build/Mac Duo.app` with an ad-hoc signature. Open it from Finder, or build and launch with:

```sh
./build.sh --run
```

macOS may require Screen Recording permission again after rebuilding with ad-hoc signing.

## Known limitations

- Only MacBooks with a compatible lid angle sensor can use the effect. The app reports when no sensor is available.
- The sensor must be one macOS marks as built-in. An external display with a similar sensor is ignored.
- The effect applies only to the built-in display.
- The effect stops when macOS sleeps as the lid closes.
- Clicks pass through the effect to the apps underneath. Press Escape to end the effect at once; Mac Duo only takes the key while the effect covers the screen.
- The window server effect relies on private Core Animation classes. If a macOS release removes them, the app captures the screen instead.
- The lid sensor's report rate is shared by the whole system and outlives the app. Mac Duo puts it back whenever it quits or the Mac sleeps, but cannot when it is force quit; `build/lidprobe reset` puts it back then, as does the next normal quit.
